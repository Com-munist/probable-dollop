# probable-dollop
The project is a simple substitution cipher encryption and decryption program. It allows users to encrypt messages using a randomly generated key and decrypt them using the same key.

Why the project is useful:

Encryption: It can be used to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
Decryption: It can be used to decrypt encrypted messages that were previously encrypted using the same key.
Learning: It can be used as a tool to learn about encryption algorithms and cryptography.
How users can get started with the project:

Clone the repository: If the project is hosted on a platform like GitHub, clone the repository to your local machine.
Install dependencies: Install any required dependencies using a package manager like pip.
Run the program: Execute the main script to start using the program.
Follow instructions: The program will provide instructions on how to encrypt and decrypt messages.

The project is maintained and contributed to by Com-munist.
